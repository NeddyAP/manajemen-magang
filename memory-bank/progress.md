*   ✅ `RefreshDatabase` trait usage
*   ✅ Base `TestCase.php` configured
*   ✅ Feature tests for Authentication flows (`tests/Feature/Auth/`)

## Recent Changes

*   **Logbook Enhancements:**
    *   Enabled 'dosen' users to add supervisor notes to logbooks via a modal.
    *   Optimized logbook pages: added back button, incorporated Tailwind CSS animations for better UX.
    *   Resolved backend authorization issues for 'dosen' access to logbooks, ensuring correct student data visibility.
*   **Features:** Implemented Notification System, User Settings, Admin Trash Management.
*   **Backend:** Added Notification controllers/API, refined Dosen access logic for other modules, added soft deletes.
*   **Frontend:** Built UI for Notifications, Settings, Trash. Added analytics cards.
*   **Testing:** Added Pest Feature tests for Authentication.
*   **Documentation:** Completed Memory Bank update to reflect recent changes.
*   **[2025-05-08 18:54:33] - Clarified Dosen report feedback: Partially implemented via rejection notes; general feedback pending.**
*   **[2025-05-08 19:02:06] - Confirmed substantial implementation of Guidance Class attendance feature (QR code via URL and manual check-in).**

## Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

### High Priority

*   None currently identified.

### Medium Priority

*   **Dosen Feedback (Reports):** Partially implemented. Dosen can add `reviewer_notes` when rejecting a report. A general feedback mechanism is still pending. (Logbook supervisor notes also offer a form of feedback).
*   **Testing Coverage:** Expand Pest test coverage beyond Auth to other core modules (Internships, Logbooks, Reports, etc.).

### Low Priority

*   **File Upload Enhancements:** Progress indicators, drag-and-drop support.
*   **Advanced Search/Filtering:** Implement more complex filtering options on index pages.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Review queries for potential N+1 issues, consider caching strategies.
*   **UI/UX Refinements:** Minor layout adjustments, mobile responsiveness improvements.
*   **TypeScript:** Address remaining `any` types, improve strictness.
*   **API Documentation:** Formal documentation for any public-facing APIs (if planned).

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Post-Documentation)

1.  **Testing:** Write Pest tests for Internship CRUD operations.
2.  **Testing:** Write Pest tests for Logbook CRUD operations (Student perspective).
3.  **Testing:** Write Pest tests for Report CRUD operations (Student perspective).

### Short-term Goals

1.  Implement general Dosen feedback feature for Reports (beyond rejection notes) and enhance Logbook feedback if needed.
3.  Continue expanding test coverage (Guidance, FAQs, Tutorials, Users, Settings).
4.  Refine Admin dashboard with more useful statistics.

### Long-term Goals

1.  Explore real-time features (e.g., notifications via WebSockets).
2.  Develop advanced analytics/reporting module.
3.  Consider mobile application or PWA development.
4.  Integrate with external systems if required.

## Technical Debt

*   **Code Quality:** Some controllers might benefit from refactoring into Services. Some frontend components could be further optimized or generalized.
*   **Testing:** Significant portion of the application lacks automated tests.
*   **Documentation:** API documentation (if needed) is missing. Inline code comments could be improved in complex sections.
*   **Infrastructure:** Caching strategy not yet implemented. Queue worker setup might need refinement for production.

## Decisions Log

### Recent Decisions

*   Adopted Pest PHP for testing.
*   Using SQLite `:memory:` for test database.
*   Implemented In-App Notifications via Database channel.
*   Standardized on Shadcn UI for frontend components.
*   Implemented Soft Deletes for recoverable data.
*   Used Indonesian language for UI text.
*   Implemented supervisor notes for logbooks using a modal.
*   Prioritized fixing 'dosen' authorization for logbooks by ensuring correct `internship_id` and `user_id` checks.

### Pending Decisions

*   Caching strategy (Redis vs. File vs. DB).
*   Deployment strategy and infrastructure choices for production.
*   Approach for handling potential real-time features.

## Metrics & KPIs (Targets)

*   **Test Coverage:** > 80%
*   **Page Load Time (Core Pages):** < 1 second
*   **API Response Time:** < 200ms
*   **System Uptime:** > 99.9%
*   **Bug Rate:** < 5 critical bugs per month post-launch

## Roadmap Status

*   **Phase 1 (Core Features):** Mostly Complete ✅
*   **Phase 2 (Refinement & Testing):** In Progress ⏳ (Notifications, Settings, Trash, Logbook Dosen Notes & UI enhancements done. Testing started. Documentation updated.)
*   **Phase 3 (Advanced Features):** Planned 📋

[2025-05-08 18:50:25] - Discovered that memory-bank/decisionLog.md was missing during Memory Bank initialization. Created the file as part of the update process.
[2025-05-08 23:49:25] - Completed task: Refactor - Remove 'title' Field from Internships. This involved creating a migration to drop the 'title' column from the `internships` table ([`database/migrations/2025_05_08_161822_remove_title_from_internships_table.php`](database/migrations/2025_05_08_161822_remove_title_from_internships_table.php)), updating the `Internship` model ([`app/Models/Internship.php`](app/Models/Internship.php)), `StoreInternshipRequest` ([`app/Http/Requests/StoreInternshipRequest.php`](app/Http/Requests/StoreInternshipRequest.php)), `UpdateInternshipRequest` ([`app/Http/Requests/UpdateInternshipRequest.php`](app/Http/Requests/UpdateInternshipRequest.php)), `InternshipFactory` ([`database/factories/InternshipFactory.php`](database/factories/InternshipFactory.php)), and `InternshipCrudTest.php` ([`tests/Feature/InternshipCrudTest.php`](tests/Feature/InternshipCrudTest.php)). The authorization logic in `InternshipApplicantController@edit` ([`app/Http/Controllers/Front/InternshipApplicantController.php`](app/Http/Controllers/Front/InternshipApplicantController.php)) was also fixed, resolving a previously failing test. All tests related to this refactoring are passing.
[2025-05-08 23:58:00] - Removed the Internship Applicant 'show' page functionality. This included: deleting the `show.tsx` file (if it existed), updating the redirect in `InternshipCrudTest.php` from the non-existent show page to the index page, removing the 'show' route from `routes/web.php`, and confirming no frontend links pointed to it.

[2025-05-09 12:03:24] - Debugged failing test `mahasiswa can update their own internship with valid data if editable` in `tests/Feature/InternshipCrudTest.php`. The issue was an incorrect redirect target in `app/Http/Controllers/Front/InternshipApplicantController.php@update`. Changed redirect from `show` route to `index` route. All tests in `InternshipCrudTest.php` now pass.
