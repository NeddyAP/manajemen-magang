## Recent Changes

- **[2025-05-13] - Test Verification & Memory Bank Update:** Verified all tests are passing via `php artisan test` (including FAQ and Tutorial CRUD). Updated memory bank (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect this. Current focus shifted to User CRUD tests (Admin).
- **[2025-05-13] - Memory Bank Update:** Reviewed and updated all core memory bank files. Confirmed `GuidanceClassCrudTest` fix. Current focus is writing Pest tests for FAQ CRUD operations.
- **[2025-05-12] - Fix: Guidance Class Student Attachment.** Updated `GuidanceClassController@store` to automatically find and attach eligible students (creating `guidance_class_attendance` records) when a new guidance class is created. This addresses a failing test in `GuidanceClassCrudTest`.
- **[2025-05-12] - Memory Bank Review:** Reviewed all core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) as requested by the user. No significant content updates were required based on the immediate preceding conversation (context condensation).
- **[2025-05-11] - Feature: Dosen Report Revision Upload.** Implemented backend (model, migration, controller, request, route, notification) and frontend (TypeScript type, UI in table, new modal) for Dosen to upload revised student reports. Added comprehensive Pest feature tests.
- **[2025-05-11] - Clarified Dosen Report Feedback:** Updated Memory Bank to reflect that Dosen can add `reviewer_notes` to reports, in addition to uploading revisions. This is distinct from a more general feedback system which is a future consideration.
- **[2025-05-11] - General Memory Bank Update:** Updated `activeContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md` to reflect the current application state.
- **[2025-05-11 09:25:53] - Confirmed and updated backend functionality for logbook export to Word and PDF. Routes in `routes/web.php` were updated to match frontend naming conventions.**
- **Logbook Enhancements:**
    - Enabled 'dosen' users to add supervisor notes to logbooks via a modal.
    - Optimized logbook pages: added back button, incorporated Tailwind CSS animations for better UX.
    - Resolved backend authorization issues for 'dosen' access to logbooks, ensuring correct student data visibility.
- **Features:** Implemented Notification System, User Settings, Admin Trash Management.
- **Backend:** Added Notification controllers/API, refined Dosen access logic for other modules, added soft deletes to individual migrations and removed consolidated one.
- **Frontend:** Built UI for Notifications, Settings, Trash. Added analytics cards. Removed Internship Applicant 'show' page.
- **Testing:** Added Pest Feature tests for Authentication, Logbooks (Student), Reports (Student), Internships (Student). Fixed tests related to Internship 'show' page removal.
- **Documentation:** Ongoing Memory Bank updates.
- \*\*[2025-05-08 18:54:33] - Clarified Dosen report feedback: Dosen can add `reviewer_notes` (especially for rejections/revisions) and upload report revisions. General, non-status-related feedback feature remains a future enhancement.
- **[2025-05-08 19:02:06] - Confirmed substantial implementation of Guidance Class attendance feature (QR code via URL and manual check-in).**
- **[2025-05-09 00:06:00] - Removed Internship Applicant 'show' page and fixed related tests in `InternshipCrudTest.php`.**
- **[2025-05-09 00:36:35] - Completed Logbook CRUD Pest Tests (Student Perspective) and refactored logbook field name from `kegiatan` to `activities`.**
- **[2025-05-09 01:04:37] - Completed Report CRUD Pest Tests (Student Perspective).**

## Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

### High Priority

- None currently identified.

### Medium Priority

- **Testing Coverage:** Expand Pest test coverage beyond current modules to other core modules (Guidance, FAQs, Tutorials, Users, Settings, Admin functions).

### Low Priority

- **File Upload Enhancements:** Progress indicators, drag-and-drop support.
- **Advanced Search/Filtering:** Implement more complex filtering options on index pages.
- **Performance Optimization:** Review queries for potential N+1 issues, consider caching strategies.
- **UI/UX Refinements:** Minor layout adjustments, mobile responsiveness improvements.
- **TypeScript:** Address remaining `any` types, improve strictness.
- **API Documentation:** Formal documentation for any public-facing APIs (if planned).

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Post-Documentation)

1.  **Testing:** Write Pest tests for User CRUD operations (Admin).
2.  **Testing:** Write Pest tests for Settings pages (all roles).
3.  **Testing:** Write Pest tests for Dosen-specific interactions and Mahasiswa view flows.

### Short-term Goals

1.  Continue expanding test coverage (Users, Settings, Admin functions).
2.  Refine Admin dashboard with more useful statistics.

### Long-term Goals

1.  Explore real-time features (e.g., notifications via WebSockets).
2.  Develop advanced analytics/reporting module.
3.  Consider mobile application or PWA development.
4.  Integrate with external systems if required.

## Technical Debt

- **Code Quality:** Some controllers might benefit from refactoring into Services. Some frontend components could be further optimized or generalized.
- **Testing:** Significant portion of the application lacks automated tests beyond Auth, Logbook (Student), Report (Student), and Internship (Student).
- **Documentation:** API documentation (if needed) is missing. Inline code comments could be improved in complex sections.
- **Infrastructure:** Caching strategy not yet implemented. Queue worker setup might need refinement for production.

## Decisions Log Link

- See [`decisionLog.md`](./decisionLog.md) for detailed decisions.

## Metrics & KPIs (Targets)

- **Test Coverage:** > 80%
- **Page Load Time (Core Pages):** < 1 second
- **API Response Time:** < 200ms
- **System Uptime:** > 99.9%
- **Bug Rate:** < 5 critical bugs per month post-launch

## Roadmap Status

- **Phase 1 (Core Features):** Mostly Complete ✅
- **Phase 2 (Refinement & Testing):** In Progress ⏳ (Notifications, Settings, Trash, Logbook Dosen Notes & UI enhancements, Logbook/Report/Internship/Guidance Class/FAQ/Tutorial CRUD tests completed. Logbook field name refactored. Soft Deletes strategy implemented. Internship 'show' page removed. Testing ongoing. Documentation updated.)
- **Phase 3 (Advanced Features):** Planned 📋
