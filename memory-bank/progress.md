## Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

### High Priority

- None currently identified.

### Medium Priority

- **Testing Coverage:** Expand Pest test coverage beyond current modules to other core modules (Guidance, FAQs, Tutorials, Users, Settings, Admin functions).

### Low Priority

- **File Upload Enhancements:** Progress indicators, drag-and-drop support.
- **Advanced Search/Filtering:** Implement more complex filtering options on index pages.
- **Performance Optimization:** Review queries for potential N+1 issues, consider caching strategies.
- **UI/UX Refinements:** Minor layout adjustments, mobile responsiveness improvements.
- **TypeScript:** Address remaining `any` types, improve strictness.
- **API Documentation:** Formal documentation for any public-facing APIs (if planned).

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Post-Documentation)

1.  **Testing:** Write Pest tests for Guidance Class CRUD operations.
2.  **Testing:** Write Pest tests for FAQ CRUD operations (Admin).
3.  **Testing:** Write Pest tests for Tutorial CRUD operations (Admin).

### Short-term Goals

1.  Continue expanding test coverage (Users, Settings, Admin functions).
2.  Refine Admin dashboard with more useful statistics.

### Long-term Goals

1.  Explore real-time features (e.g., notifications via WebSockets).
2.  Develop advanced analytics/reporting module.
3.  Consider mobile application or PWA development.
4.  Integrate with external systems if required.

## Technical Debt

- **Code Quality:** Some controllers might benefit from refactoring into Services. Some frontend components could be further optimized or generalized.
- **Testing:** Significant portion of the application lacks automated tests beyond Auth, Logbook (Student), Report (Student), and Internship (Student).
- **Documentation:** API documentation (if needed) is missing. Inline code comments could be improved in complex sections.
- **Infrastructure:** Caching strategy not yet implemented. Queue worker setup might need refinement for production.
