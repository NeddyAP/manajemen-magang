## Progress - July 15, 2024

### What Works

- **Core Application Features**:
    - User authentication (login, registration, logout).
    - Internship management (CRUD for internships).
    - Student features: applying for internships, submitting reports and logbooks.
    - Company features: posting internships, managing applications.
    - Admin features: managing users, companies, internships, and site settings.
    - Search functionality for various resources (students, companies, internships, reports, logbooks) for both Admin and Front views.
- **Testing**:
    - All 192 PHPUnit/Pest tests are passing.
    - `AdminSearchTest.php` is functional and tests admin search capabilities.
    - `FrontSearchTest.php` is functional, testing front-end search capabilities, and has been successfully refactored from Pest to PHPUnit class-based structure.
    - Admin User CRUD operations are tested and passing via `tests/Feature/Admin/UserCrudTest.php`.

### What's Left to Build

- **Frontend Testing Implementation**:
    - Set up Vitest and React Testing Library for frontend testing.
    - Implement tests for auth components (login, register, password reset, email verification).
    - Implement tests for CRUD operations on core features (internships, logbooks, reports).
    - Implement tests for search functionality and pagination.
    - Implement tests for form validation and error handling.
    - Implement tests for authorization checks on the frontend.
- **Backend Testing Expansion**:
    - Complete tests for settings pages (all roles).
    - Expand test coverage for Dosen-specific interactions.
    - Expand test coverage for Mahasiswa view flows.
- **Further Feature Development**: (To be populated based on `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` if not already covered or if new features are planned).
- **Refinements & Bug Fixes**: (Ongoing, based on testing and user feedback).

### Current Status

- **Development**: Actively working on enhancing test coverage. The current focus is on implementing frontend tests.
- **Test Suite**: Backend tests are stable and passing. Frontend tests need to be implemented.
- **Deployment**: (Information about current deployment status, if any, would go here. e.g., Staging, Production environment details).

### Known Issues

- Frontend test directories exist but are currently empty, indicating frontend testing is planned but not yet implemented.

### Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Frontend Testing Strategy**: The decision has been made to use Vitest and React Testing Library for frontend testing. This aligns with modern React testing practices and provides a good foundation for testing React components.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: The application uses Spatie Laravel Permission for role-based access control, with a superadmin bypass implemented in AuthServiceProvider. This provides a flexible and powerful authorization system.
- **Modern Frontend Stack**: The frontend uses React 19 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, providing a good foundation for implementing modern frontend testing practices.

## Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

### High Priority

- **Frontend Testing:** Implement frontend tests using Vitest and React Testing Library, starting with auth components.

### Medium Priority

- **Testing Coverage:** Expand backend test coverage beyond current modules to other core modules (Settings, Admin functions).
- **Documentation:** Ensure all code is well-documented, especially complex business logic.

### Low Priority

- **File Upload Enhancements:** Progress indicators, drag-and-drop support.
- **Advanced Search/Filtering:** Implement more complex filtering options on index pages.
- **Performance Optimization:** Review queries for potential N+1 issues, consider caching strategies.
- **UI/UX Refinements:** Minor layout adjustments, mobile responsiveness improvements.
- **TypeScript:** Address remaining `any` types, improve strictness.
- **API Documentation:** Formal documentation for any public-facing APIs (if planned).

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Post-Documentation)

1.  **Testing:** Implement frontend tests using Vitest and React Testing Library for auth components.
2.  **Testing:** Expand frontend test coverage to other core features (CRUD operations, search, pagination).
3.  **Testing:** Complete backend tests for settings pages (all roles).

### Short-term Goals

1.  Continue expanding test coverage (frontend and backend).
2.  Refine Admin dashboard with more useful statistics.
3.  Improve documentation for complex business logic.

### Long-term Goals

1.  Explore real-time features (e.g., notifications via WebSockets).
2.  Develop advanced analytics/reporting module.
3.  Consider mobile application or PWA development.
4.  Integrate with external systems if required.

## Technical Debt

- **Code Quality:** Some controllers might benefit from refactoring into Services. Some frontend components could be further optimized or generalized.
- **Testing:** Backend tests are well-established, but frontend tests are completely missing. This is a significant gap that needs to be addressed.
- **Documentation:** API documentation (if needed) is missing. Inline code comments could be improved in complex sections.
- **Infrastructure:** Caching strategy not yet implemented. Queue worker setup might need refinement for production.
- **TypeScript:** Some areas of the codebase could benefit from stricter type definitions and fewer `any` types.

## Metrics & KPIs (Targets)

- **Test Coverage:** > 80%
- **Page Load Time (Core Pages):** < 1 second
- **API Response Time:** < 200ms
- **System Uptime:** > 99.9%
- **Bug Rate:** < 5 critical bugs per month post-launch

## Roadmap Status

- **Phase 1 (Core Features):** Complete ✅
- **Phase 2 (Refinement & Testing):** In Progress ⏳ (Backend testing well-established, frontend testing planned but not yet implemented. Documentation updated.)
- **Phase 3 (Advanced Features):** Planned 📋

[2025-01-06 12:42:56] - **MahasiswaDashboardController Deletion**: Successfully deleted `app/Http/Controllers/Front/MahasiswaDashboardController.php` as part of the Mahasiswa Dashboard removal refactoring. This completes the cleanup of unused controller code following the route removal and redirect implementation.

[2025-01-06 12:44:35] - **Mahasiswa Dashboard View File Deletion**: Successfully deleted `resources/js/pages/front/mahasiswa/dashboard.tsx` as part of Task 3 of the Mahasiswa Dashboard removal refactoring. This completes the frontend cleanup following the route removal, redirect implementation, and controller deletion. The view file contained 105 lines of React/TypeScript code with dashboard components that are no longer needed.

[2025-01-06 12:45:53] - **Task 4 Completed - Mahasiswa Dashboard Test Search**: Conducted comprehensive search for test files referencing "MahasiswaDashboardController", "/mahasiswa/dashboard", "Dashboard", and "mahasiswa" patterns in the tests/ directory. Found 181 references to "mahasiswa" but all are legitimate references to the student role functionality (user factories, permissions, CRUD operations, etc.). No test files were found that specifically tested the removed MahasiswaDashboardController or `/mahasiswa/dashboard` route, indicating that no test cleanup is required. This completes the Mahasiswa Dashboard removal refactoring across all application layers.
