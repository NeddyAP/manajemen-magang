## Progress - May 13, 2025

### What Works

- **Core Application Features**:
    - User authentication (login, registration, logout).
    - Internship management (CRUD for internships).
    - Student features: applying for internships, submitting reports and logbooks.
    - Company features: posting internships, managing applications.
    - Admin features: managing users, companies, internships, and site settings.
    - Search functionality for various resources (students, companies, internships, reports, logbooks) for both Admin and Front views.
- **Testing**:
    - All 192 PHPUnit/Pest tests are passing.
    - `AdminSearchTest.php` is functional and tests admin search capabilities.
    - `FrontSearchTest.php` is functional, testing front-end search capabilities, and has been successfully refactored from Pest to PHPUnit class-based structure.

### What's Left to Build

- **User CRUD Tests (Admin)**: As per `activeContext.md`, the next immediate task is to write Pest tests for User CRUD operations by an Admin.
    - Test admin can view list of users.
    - Test admin can view a single user.
    - Test admin can create a new user (student, admin, dosen) with appropriate roles and profiles.
    - Test admin can edit an existing user's details, roles, and profile.
    - Test admin can delete a user.
    - Test validation for user creation and updates.
    - Test authorization checks.
- **Further Feature Development**: (To be populated based on `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` if not already covered or if new features are planned).
- **Refinements & Bug Fixes**: (Ongoing, based on testing and user feedback).

### Current Status

- **Development**: Actively working on enhancing test coverage. The recent focus was on refactoring and fixing search tests.
- **Test Suite**: Stable and all tests passing.
- **Deployment**: (Information about current deployment status, if any, would go here. e.g., Staging, Production environment details).

### Known Issues

- None currently identified. All previously noted test failures have been resolved.

### Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Test Structure for `FrontSearchTest.php`**: Initially implemented using Pest syntax. Due to persistent test failures that were difficult to debug with Pest's functional style in this specific case, the decision was made to refactor `FrontSearchTest.php` to a traditional PHPUnit class-based structure. This resolved the issues and brought it in line with other feature tests like `AdminSearchTest.php`. This indicates a pragmatic approach to test implementation, prioritizing stability and debuggability.
- **URL Corrections in `AdminSearchTest.php`**: Identified and corrected incorrect URLs for report and logbook search tests, reinforcing the need for careful verification of test parameters against application routes.

## Recent Changes (Consolidated Summary - Last ~Week)

- **Test Suite Refinement & Verification (May 13, 2025):**
    - Successfully refactored `FrontSearchTest.php` from Pest to a PHPUnit class-based structure to resolve test failures and improve clarity.
    - Updated `AdminSearchTest.php` with class name changes, `use Tests\TestCase;`, and corrected URLs.
    - Verified all 192 tests are passing.
    - Completed and verified Pest feature tests for FAQ and Tutorial CRUD operations.
- **Memory Bank Synchronization (May 13, 2025):**
    - Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to reflect the latest test completions and refactoring.
    - Conducted reviews of all core memory bank files to ensure consistency.
- **Guidance System Enhancement (May 12, 2025):**
    - Fixed an issue in `GuidanceClassController@store` to ensure automatic attachment of eligible students and creation of attendance records when a new guidance class is created. This resolved a failing test in `GuidanceClassCrudTest`.
- **Reporting Feature Enhancement (May 11, 2025):**
    - Implemented functionality for Dosen to upload revised student reports. This included backend (model, migration, controller, request, route, notification) and frontend (TypeScript type, UI updates, new modal) changes.
    - Added comprehensive Pest feature tests for the report revision upload feature.
    - Clarified in documentation that Dosen can add `reviewer_notes` to reports in addition to uploading revisions.
- **Logbook Enhancements (Prior to May 11, 2025):**
    - Enabled Dosen to add supervisor notes to logbooks via a modal.
    - Confirmed and updated backend functionality for logbook export to Word and PDF.
    - Optimized logbook pages with UI improvements (back button, animations).
    - Resolved backend authorization issues for Dosen access to logbooks.
- **Core Feature Implementation (Prior to May 11, 2025):**
    - Implemented Notification System, User Settings, and Admin Trash Management features.
    - Added soft deletes to individual migrations and removed a consolidated soft delete migration.
- **Test Coverage Expansion (Ongoing, prior to May 11, 2025):**
    - Completed Pest feature tests for Authentication, Logbooks (Student), Reports (Student), and Internships (Student).
    - Refactored logbook field name from `kegiatan` to `activities` and updated relevant tests.

## Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

### High Priority

- None currently identified.

### Medium Priority

- **Testing Coverage:** Expand Pest test coverage beyond current modules to other core modules (Guidance, FAQs, Tutorials, Users, Settings, Admin functions).

### Low Priority

- **File Upload Enhancements:** Progress indicators, drag-and-drop support.
- **Advanced Search/Filtering:** Implement more complex filtering options on index pages.
- **Performance Optimization:** Review queries for potential N+1 issues, consider caching strategies.
- **UI/UX Refinements:** Minor layout adjustments, mobile responsiveness improvements.
- **TypeScript:** Address remaining `any` types, improve strictness.
- **API Documentation:** Formal documentation for any public-facing APIs (if planned).

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Post-Documentation)

1.  **Testing:** Write Pest tests for User CRUD operations (Admin).
2.  **Testing:** Write Pest tests for Settings pages (all roles).
3.  **Testing:** Write Pest tests for Dosen-specific interactions and Mahasiswa view flows.

### Short-term Goals

1.  Continue expanding test coverage (Users, Settings, Admin functions).
2.  Refine Admin dashboard with more useful statistics.

### Long-term Goals

1.  Explore real-time features (e.g., notifications via WebSockets).
2.  Develop advanced analytics/reporting module.
3.  Consider mobile application or PWA development.
4.  Integrate with external systems if required.

## Technical Debt

- **Code Quality:** Some controllers might benefit from refactoring into Services. Some frontend components could be further optimized or generalized.
- **Testing:** Significant portion of the application lacks automated tests beyond Auth, Logbook (Student), Report (Student), and Internship (Student).
- **Documentation:** API documentation (if needed) is missing. Inline code comments could be improved in complex sections.
- **Infrastructure:** Caching strategy not yet implemented. Queue worker setup might need refinement for production.
