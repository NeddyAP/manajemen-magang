## Recent Changes

### Backend Changes

1. Database schema implementations
2. Controller logic refinements
3. File handling optimizations
4. Security enhancements
5. Modified front-end controllers (`InternshipApplicantController`, `LogbookController`, `ReportController`, `GuidanceClassController`, `InternshipController`) to calculate and pass aggregate statistics (counts, status breakdowns) to their respective index views.
6. **Notification System:** Added API endpoints and controller methods (`markAsUnread`, `destroy`) for managing notifications.
7. **Notification Links:** Corrected link generation in `ApplicationStatusChanged` notification.

### Frontend Changes

1. UI component development
2. Form validation improvements
3. TypeScript type definitions
4. Layout system implementation
5. Added analytics cards/badges to front-end internship index pages (applicants, logbooks, reports, guidance classes, main hub) displaying summary statistics.
6. **Notification System:**
    - Fixed unread count badge display in header dropdown.
    - Created notification history page (`front/notifications/index.tsx`) using `FrontLayout`.
    - Implemented Mark as Unread and Delete actions (with confirmation) on history page.
    - Refactored history page UI using `<Card>` components.
    - Ensured clicks on notifications navigate to the link provided by the backend.

## Known Issues

### High Priority

1. None currently identified

### Medium Priority

1. File upload size optimization needed
2. Cache configuration refinement
3. Performance optimization for large datasets

### Low Priority

1. Additional documentation needed (API for new notification endpoints)
2. UI/UX improvements for mobile
3. Extended testing coverage (especially for notification actions)
4. TypeScript `any` type warnings in `app-header.tsx` and `notifications/index.tsx` related to `NotificationData`.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Testing:** Comprehensive tests for Notification System (backend, API, frontend actions)
2. **Notification Links:** Review/Refine Logbook/Report notification links
3. **TypeScript:** Address `any` type warnings
4. Optimize file upload handling
5. Enhance mobile responsiveness
6. Implement additional caching
7. Add comprehensive testing

### Short-term Goals

1. Performance optimization
2. Enhanced reporting features
3. Extended API documentation
4. User feedback integration

### Long-term Goals

1. Mobile application development
2. Machine learning integration
3. Advanced analytics
4. Cross-institution features

## Technical Debt

### Code Quality

- Additional TypeScript types needed (`NotificationData`)
- Controller refactoring opportunities
- Test coverage expansion (Notifications)
- Documentation updates (Notification API)

### Infrastructure

- Caching strategy optimization
- Queue system enhancement
- Backup system improvement
- Monitoring implementation

### Security

- Regular security audits
- Penetration testing
- Compliance verification
- Access control review

## Decisions Log

### Recent Decisions
