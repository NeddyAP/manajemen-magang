*   **Auth/Permissions:** ✅ (`roles`, `permissions`, `model_has_roles`, `model_has_permissions`, `role_has_permissions`)
*   **Feature Tables:** ✅ (`internships`, `logbooks`, `reports`, `guidance_classes`, `guidance_class_attendance`)
*   **Support Tables:** ✅ (`tutorials`, `faqs`, `global_variables`, `notifications`)
*   **Framework Tables:** ✅ (`migrations`, `jobs`, `failed_jobs`, `cache`, `cache_locks`)
*   **Soft Deletes:** ✅ Added to relevant models (Users, FAQs, Tutorials, etc.)

### Implementation Progress

#### Backend (Laravel 12.x)

*   ✅ Authentication & Authorization (Fortify/Sanctum adapted, Spatie Permissions)
*   ✅ Core Model relationships defined
*   ✅ Controller logic for CRUD operations
*   ✅ Form Requests for validation
*   ✅ Database migrations and seeders (basic)
*   ✅ Inertia.js integration (`HandleInertiaRequests` middleware, data sharing)
*   ✅ Notification system (Laravel Notifications, Database channel, API endpoints)
*   ✅ File upload handling (Laravel Filesystem)
*   ✅ Soft Deletes implementation
*   ✅ Basic API endpoints for notifications

#### Frontend (React 18+ / TypeScript / Vite)

*   ✅ Component architecture (Shadcn UI base)
*   ✅ Page layouts (`AuthLayout`, `FrontLayout`, `AdminLayout` via `AppShell`)
*   ✅ Inertia form handling (`useForm`)
*   ✅ Data tables (`react-table` usage within custom components)
*   ✅ UI for core CRUD operations
*   ✅ Navigation system (Sidebar, Header)
*   ✅ Notification UI (Header dropdown, History page)
*   ✅ User Settings UI
*   ✅ Admin Dashboard UI
*   ✅ Trash Management UI
*   ✅ TypeScript types for core models and props (ongoing refinement)

#### Testing (Pest PHP / SQLite :memory:)

*   ✅ Setup for Pest testing environment
*   ✅ `RefreshDatabase` trait usage
*   ✅ Base `TestCase.php` configured
*   ✅ Feature tests for Authentication flows (`tests/Feature/Auth/`)

## Recent Changes (Summary - Pre-Documentation Update)

*   **Features:** Implemented Notification System, User Settings, Admin Trash Management.
*   **Backend:** Added Notification controllers/API, refined Dosen access logic, added soft deletes.
*   **Frontend:** Built UI for Notifications, Settings, Trash. Added analytics cards.
*   **Testing:** Added Pest Feature tests for Authentication.
*   **Documentation:** **Currently updating Memory Bank files.**

## Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

### High Priority

*   None currently identified.

### Medium Priority

*   **Guidance Class Attendance:** Implement a functional attendance mechanism (QR or manual check-in).
*   **Dosen Feedback:** Add UI/backend logic for Dosen to add feedback to Logbooks/Reports.
*   **Testing Coverage:** Expand Pest test coverage beyond Auth to other core modules (Internships, Logbooks, Reports, etc.).

### Low Priority

*   **File Upload Enhancements:** Progress indicators, drag-and-drop support.
*   **Advanced Search/Filtering:** Implement more complex filtering options on index pages.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Review queries for potential N+1 issues, consider caching strategies.
*   **UI/UX Refinements:** Minor layout adjustments, mobile responsiveness improvements.
*   **TypeScript:** Address remaining `any` types, improve strictness.
*   **API Documentation:** Formal documentation for any public-facing APIs (if planned).

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Post-Documentation)

1.  **Testing:** Write Pest tests for Internship CRUD operations.
2.  **Testing:** Write Pest tests for Logbook CRUD operations (Student perspective).
3.  **Testing:** Write Pest tests for Report CRUD operations (Student perspective).

### Short-term Goals

1.  Implement Guidance Class attendance feature.
2.  Implement Dosen feedback feature for Logbooks/Reports.
3.  Continue expanding test coverage (Guidance, FAQs, Tutorials, Users, Settings).
4.  Refine Admin dashboard with more useful statistics.

### Long-term Goals

1.  Explore real-time features (e.g., notifications via WebSockets).
2.  Develop advanced analytics/reporting module.
3.  Consider mobile application or PWA development.
4.  Integrate with external systems if required.

## Technical Debt

*   **Code Quality:** Some controllers might benefit from refactoring into Services. Some frontend components could be further optimized or generalized.
*   **Testing:** Significant portion of the application lacks automated tests.
*   **Documentation:** API documentation (if needed) is missing. Inline code comments could be improved in complex sections.
*   **Infrastructure:** Caching strategy not yet implemented. Queue worker setup might need refinement for production.

## Decisions Log

### Recent Decisions

*   Adopted Pest PHP for testing.
*   Using SQLite `:memory:` for test database.
*   Implemented In-App Notifications via Database channel.
*   Standardized on Shadcn UI for frontend components.
*   Implemented Soft Deletes for recoverable data.
*   Used Indonesian language for UI text.

### Pending Decisions

*   Specific mechanism for Guidance Class attendance (QR vs. Manual).
*   Caching strategy (Redis vs. File vs. DB).
*   Deployment strategy and infrastructure choices for production.
*   Approach for handling potential real-time features.

## Metrics & KPIs (Targets)

*   **Test Coverage:** > 80%
*   **Page Load Time (Core Pages):** < 1 second
*   **API Response Time:** < 200ms
*   **System Uptime:** > 99.9%
*   **Bug Rate:** < 5 critical bugs per month post-launch

## Roadmap Status

*   **Phase 1 (Core Features):** Mostly Complete ✅
*   **Phase 2 (Refinement & Testing):** In Progress ⏳ (Notifications, Settings, Trash done. Testing started. Documentation update ongoing.)
*   **Phase 3 (Advanced Features):** Planned 📋
